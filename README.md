## 🚀 About Arc Land

**Arc Land** is a decentralized land ownership dApp on **Arc Network (Testnet)**. Every parcel on the 50×50 grid is a permanent, on-chain asset — owned, named, and colored by real wallet addresses.

Instead of static maps, Arc Land is a **live blockchain grid** where users can explore claimed territory, inspect owners, buy and sell parcels, and build their on-chain presence.

The goal of Arc Land is to make **on-chain ownership tangible, visual, and interactive** within the Arc ecosystem.

## 💡 How It Works

### 1. Connect Wallet
Supported wallets: MetaMask, Rabby, OKX, Coinbase Wallet, Trust Wallet — any EVM wallet.
Arc Network must be added (Chain ID: `5042002`). The app auto-prompts to add/switch.

### 2. Get Testnet USDC
Visit [faucet.circle.com](https://faucet.circle.com), select Arc Testnet, and request USDC.
USDC is the native gas token on Arc — used for both gas fees and parcel purchases.

### 3. Claim a Parcel
Click any empty cell on the map → **CLAIM PARCEL** button appears.

**Pricing:**
| Owned Neighbors | Price |
|---|---|
| 0 | 0.5 USDC |
| 1 | 0.6 USDC |
| 2 | 0.7 USDC |
| 3 | 0.8 USDC |
| 4 | 0.9 USDC (max) |

> Each neighboring parcel already owned by anyone adds +0.1 USDC to the base price.

### 4. Customize Your Parcel
After claiming, set a **name** and **color** for your parcel. Both are stored on-chain via `setName()` and `setColor()` contract calls.

### 5. List for Sale
Open any parcel you own → **LIST FOR SALE** → enter your price in USDC.
Platform fee: **5%** deducted on sale. Cancel listing at any time.

### 6. Buy Other Parcels
Amber-pulsing parcels on the map are listed for sale. Click one → **BUY** → confirm the transaction.
